example new record
==================
id [-999]
name []
steckerboard []
rotorcount [0]
entrylist []
rotorlist []
reflectorlist []
alphabetid [-999]
FINISH:: WheelBaseData::dispRec()

===================================================

Add a machine
=============

id must be -999

name must not exist and may not be empty and must contain a minimum number of chars
alphabet id must exist on alphabet table

steckerboard = YES or NO

rotor count >= 0

entrylist must contain at least one valid entry wheel with same alphabet id

rotorlist must contain at least as many entries as the rotor count. Each
rotor in the list must be a valid rotor with the required alphabet id

reflectorlist must contain at least one valid reflector wheel with the required
alphabet id

===================================================

Edit a machine
==============

id must not be -999 
id must exist on the machine table

name must not exist with a different id on the machine table and may not be empty and 
must contain a minimum number of chars

alphabet id must exist on alphabet table
steckerboard = YES or NO
rotor count >= 0
entrylist must contain at least one valid entry wheel with same alphabet id

rotorlist must contain at least as many entries as the rotor count. Each
rotor in the list must be a valid rotor with the required alphabet id

reflectorlist must contain at least one valid reflector wheel with the required
alphabet id

Any changes to the machine definition must not invalidate a record on the
machine definition table (enigma.machinedefn)

===================================================

Delete a machine
================
id must not be -999
id must exist on the machine table
id must not be in use on the machine definition table (enigma.machinedefn)
