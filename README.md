Simulator for WW II Enigma cyper machine.

Built with:
QT 4.8
Qt Creator 2.4.1
MySql 5.5.31

Although there are hundreds of enigma machine simulators available, this
is the only one, as far as I know, that permits infinite permutations of
rotors, steckerboard, entry wheels and reflector wheels.

Essentially this is a research tool and a fun toy.

This code is a work in progress.
